  <h2>Stream Outline</h2>

  <p>We plan to stream game reviews on YouTube for 3-5 hours. We'll start by preparing, then recording, have a break time (more if needed), continuing the recording, start editing, have another break time, continue editing, then finish streaming. 
  </p>

  <p>We will also talk to our viewers while we stream; the topics we will talk about will focus on the video games we are playing.</p>

  <p>We do not predict that we will be changing our content in the middle of the stream, I think if we do that then it will be targeting a different audience and our viewers might lose interest.
  </p>

  <p>For interactions in the audience, we can livestream our gameplays and game reviews while also making a poll for the viewers that are watching the livestream to answer some fun questions.
  </p>

  <p>On the topic on what we will display for the duation of the stream, we will demonstrate how the game works and make it appealing for the viewers on our screen. We will also display various reviews regarding the game, such as how simple it is to play and how appropriate it is for all ages.
  </p>

  <p>Every hour, overlay changes might appear sloppy. To avoid boring the viewers, we will just employ one or two overlays to alter during the show.
  </p>

  <p>We will not have breaks when broadcasting because it is continuous, and we have already determined how long the stream will be.
  </p>

  <p>To avoid violating any Copyright acts; Perhaps we will ask one of the members in the group to create a video tutorial explaining the game‚Äôs mechanics. And we‚Äôll show it out during the stream. So yes, there might be a video presented while streaming.

  <h4>For the Promotional Plan:</h4>

  <p></p>
  <h4>For this Website:</h4>
  <p>While I did take assests from the downloadable source of documentation website hoster, ReadtheDocs; I had to completely rearrange the code myself as I found it too messy to work on as is. That is why I have stated previously that I did it from scratch. What I forgot to include in my statement is that I have taken the assets from ReadtheDocs but made everything fresh and put my own code by mostly redoing the structure of the code.</p>
  <p>I would like to credit them for the format and reference for what I had in mind creating the website. The CSS are from ReadtheDocs but most of the programmed content in the <b>index.html</b> file is by Niccolai Miclat.</p>
  <p>I am not taking the credit away from ReadtheDocs and I am most certainly <b>NOT</b> encouraging plaigarism as the code for ReadtheDocs is open source but I have provided a link to the direct source of the code I borrowed and reformatted.</p>
